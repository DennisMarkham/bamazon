# bamazon
This application is meant to be run with node.  Open your gitBash in the bamazon folder and type "bamazonCustomer.js" to begin.  This will bring up the catalog of all the items in the store.  This will include the item id number, product name, department name, price, and quantity in stock.  Then you will be prompted to enter the id number and the quantity you would like to buy.

Ideally, this would then display either the price you were expected to pay for the transaction, or, if your demand exceeded the quantity, it would say "Insufficent quantity" in the console.  Then, either way, the program would end.  However, this does not work at present, as the screenshots provided will show.
